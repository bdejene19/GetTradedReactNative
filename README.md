## About
Contractor Contacts is a full stack mobile app, built to help contract workers showcase their work. With built in functionality that allows users to upload photos from their mobile gallery, users are able to share their individual businesses' profile page. This includes: Business Name, Contact Info, Images of work to shocase, and an About the Business section. When complete, 2 types of users will exist - contractors and job posters. Job posters will have the ability fo view contractor profiles or message them directly to determine details of the contract work.

## Installation
###Requirements:
Currently, Contractor Contacts only supports iOS devices. This application is also a mobile app, which requires developers to have a simulator installed on their computer. On Mac, I suggest XCode.

Additionally, the backend of this application is built with MySQL, requiring MySQL Server to be installed on your computer, and running while the app is running.
